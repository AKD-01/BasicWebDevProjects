      <h1>Santa Monica Beach, California</h1>
      <p>
        Spanning 3.5 miles, Santa Monica Beach is where nostalgia meets
        California living. Along Ocean Front Walk, fitness enthusiasts take
        advantage of retro workout equipment, while the Marvin Braude Bike Trail
        hums with tanned skateboarders, rollerbladers and cyclists at, perhaps,
        the most famous beach in the world. Most recognizable is the circa-1909
        pier with its street-performers, artists, historic carousel and
        solar-powered Ferris wheel. Book a room at Shutters on the Beach to be
        in the heart of the action.

        Glamorous hotels, clubs and restaurants converge in South Beach, but the
        American Riviera is most famous for its Art Deco vibe and two miles of
        white sand. Rack up Instagram likes by the 35 bright and funky lifeguard
        towers at one of the most popular beaches, and rent a DecoBike to
        explore the Art Deco Historic District’s 800 landmarks built from 1923
        to 1943. Called the grand dame of Art Deco design, the Raleigh hotel has
        been a hot spot since 1940. See if South Beach made the list of the best
        beaches in the United States.

        The Renaissance Aruba Resort & Casino’s man-made private island is the
        only place in Aruba to take a selfie with flamboyance of flamingos, who
        are happy to oblige in return for kibble from a vending machine (bring
        quarters). The island is open only to resort guests, though a limited
        number of day passes are sold each morning. Flamingo Beach is
        adults-only, but kids can spy sunbathing iguanas on Ren Island’s
        family-friendly beach.

        In 1901, the Moana Surfrider resort opened on the south shore of Oahu,
        and Waikiki’s status as a prime vacation spot was cemented. More than a
        century later, a multimillion-dollar refurbishment transformed Kuhio
        Beach and the Waikiki Beach Walk, an alfresco promenade that buzzes with
        live music, nightlife, restaurants and shops.

        Basted onto the travel map after the release of the film The Beach in
        2000, Maya Bay sees more tourists than it can literally handle.
        Thailand’s Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation
        closed the beach for four months in 2018 for reef recovery, and, since
        reopening, it’s been capped at 2,000 visitors a day, making it, perhaps,
        the world’s most famous beach. Those who make the cut can ogle the
        famous sugar sand and 300-foot cliffs in person. The neighboring island
        of Phi Phi Don holds the Phi Phi Islands’ only accommodations, including
        Zeavola’s rustic-chic suites.
